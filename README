chess-at-nite is a chess engine written in C/C++. It supports the usage
of xboard/winboard for a graphical representation.

chess-at-nite uses a x88 board representation to do fast move generation
and calculations. The basic search algorithm is a heavly modified alpha-
beta implementation with several heuristics.

You can try using xboard/winboard support by starting xboard using the
chess-at-nite engine (Mac OSX/Linux):

$ xboard -fcp "./chess-at-nite" -fd "/path/to/chess-at-nite/bin/"
